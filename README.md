My bash and vim settings. Most of my vim settings are for
gVim, but I do use the occasional terminal vim for quick
editing. A preview of my [gVim](http://i.imgur.com/zhY3NWS.png),
and the [terminal vim](http://i.imgur.com/GwAP1yz.png).

On gVim I'm using the mustang color scheme and Consolas
at 13px, while on terminal vim I use the grb4 and consolas font
at 13pt.

`bashrc` settings are to customize the prompt and `$PATH`,
most of them were stolen from/inspired by `mistsuhiko`'s
[bashrc](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/bashrc),
and I just took the color for keywords form the mustang color
scheme and used it everywhere. It gives my terminal a _heroku_
like look.
