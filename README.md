dotfiles
========

My personal configuration for everything I use on
(mostly) a daily basis. Some parts are unshamefully
stolen from other people's dotfiles. Configures the
following tools:

- Git
  - ``lg`` shows a compacted graph
  - ``graph`` shows a really pretty graph
  - ``lg1`` and ``lg2`` are both graphs as well
  - ``compress`` compacts the current repo
  - pager is ``less -R`` which has color
  - uses vim as the editor
- Vim
  - Uses Vundle as a plugin manager
  - Some sane defaults copied from elsewhere
  - Uses the **mustang** colorscheme
  - Adjust some coloring for Python syntax
  - Remaps some keys
- Bash
  - A really minimal prompt
  - ``hfind`` searches history
  - ``json`` uses the python json tool
  - ``tree`` ignores bytecode files
  - ``g`` aliases to git
  - ``sql`` aliases to ``sqlite3``
  - ``chrome`` opens the cask-installed Google Chrome
  - ``cd`` is actually ``pushd``
