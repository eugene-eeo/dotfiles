# dotfiles

My personal configuration for everything I use on
(mostly) a daily basis. Some parts are unshamefully
stolen from other dotfiles.

> Yes I still use makefiles. Get off my lawn.

```sh
$ make          # repo -> home
$ make copy     # home -> repo
```

Usual workflow is to work on dotfiles in this
repo and then run `make` to test the settings.
