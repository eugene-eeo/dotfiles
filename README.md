# dotfiles

My personal configuration for everything I use on
(mostly) a daily basis. Some parts are unshamefully
stolen from other dotfiles.

> Yes I still use makefiles. Get off my lawn.

```sh
$ make # repo -> home
```

This repo is meant as a single source of truth for the
dotfiles on my system. Works on Ubuntu.
