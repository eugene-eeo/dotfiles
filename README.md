# dotfiles

My personal configuration for everything I use on
(mostly) a daily basis. Some parts are unshamefully
stolen from other dotfiles. If you're after how to
configure the hottest plugin I most probably do not
have it, I simply have what works for me best.

> Yes I still use makefiles. Get off my lawn.

```sh
$ make          # repo -> home
$ make copy     # home -> repo
```

Usual workflow is to work on dotfiles in *this*
repo and then run `make`, and test the settings.
