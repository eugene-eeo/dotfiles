My bash and vim settings. Most of my vim settings are for
gVim, but I do use the occasional terminal vim for quick
editing. A preview of my [gVim](http://i.imgur.com/zhY3NWS.png),
and the [terminal vim](http://i.imgur.com/GwAP1yz.png).

On gVim I'm using the mustang color scheme and Letter Gothic
at 11px, while on terminal vim I use the grb4 and consolas font
at 11pt. Bashrc settings are very minimal, mostly just to
customize the prompt and the `$PATH`.
